/*
The last 20 minutes.The last 20 minutes of my OI road.
I couldn't type any codes out right now(even a violent code),
maybe I also wouldn't make it any other time.
I started with the success of "a+b Problem",
and end up with the complete failure in NOIP 2021.
I just like Faust,didn't cried out"You are so beautiful,please slow down!" until he is dying.
Now,I just want to close my eyes,and enjoy counting the few secounds remained,
because it must be the last time I join in OI competetion.
However,I won't just give OI up,I still believe that I just have to leave it for a short time.
Maybe as soon as I go to the college,I'll pick it up again.
At last,wish you good luck,the stranger before the screen.Don't give OI up so easily as me,you are intelligent enough to make a legend.
